# Pinpoint Go Agent

This is the official Go agent for [Pinpoint](https://github.com/pinpoint-apm/pinpoint).

Pinpoint Go Agent enables you to monitor Go applications using Pinpoint.
Go applications must be instrumented manually at the source code level,
because Go is a compiled language and does not have a virtual machine like Java.
Developers can instrument Go applications using the APIs provided in this package.

## Installation

go get github.com/pinpoint-apm/pinpoint-go-agent
```

* Go 1.21+
* Pinpoint 2.4.0+
* Linux, OS X, and Windows are supported.

## Plug-ins

and plug-ins for popular frameworks and toolkits.
These packages help you to make instruments with simple source code modifications.
